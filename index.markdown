    We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard. That you should be able to host your website wherever you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. Our tools should be simple, but never dumbed down.

    Static sites are faster, more secure, and keep visitors happy. And speed matters: According to Google, **nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile site if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds**.

    Best of all, unlike legacy CMSs such as WordPress and Drupal, your website’s entire source code and content are completely portable. Never be locked into a particular service again. An Open Web is a better web.
